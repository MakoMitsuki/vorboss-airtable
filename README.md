# Vorboss Airtable Admin Console

Alice has recently started a business selling 3D printed jewellery for cats. 
As you would expect business is booming and Alice wants to keep track of the success of the business with a metrics dashboard.

She is currently managing her orders in a spreasheet in [Airtable](https://airtable.com), and would like to continue to be able to do so.

She would like her dashboard to contain some key figures, such as:
- Total Orders
- Total Orders this month
- Number of orders in progress
- Revenue
- A list of the most recent few orders

..and anything else that you think that she may find useful.
